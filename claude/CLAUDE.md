# Directives
- When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

# CLI Tools
- Always use `fd` instead of `find`.
- Always use `rg` instead of `grep`.

# Shell Scripts
- When writing shell scripts, always write POSIX compatible and always use `#!/usr/bin/env sh` shebang.
