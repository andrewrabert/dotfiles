# Neovim Configuration

This is a Neovim configuration directory. When working with this codebase:

- Main entry point typically in `init.lua`
- Plugin specs usually in `lua/plugins/` or similar
- Keymaps, options, and autocommands in separate modules
- Follow existing code style and organization patterns
- Test changes in Neovim before committing
- Check for syntax errors with `:checkhealth`
